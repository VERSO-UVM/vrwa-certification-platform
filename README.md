# Vermont Rural Water Association - Training Database

One of the primary functions of the Vermont Rural Water Association is to provide training classes to water & wastewater operators. These classes are worth varying numbers of credit hours.
For the last 10 or so years, records of who has taken what classes has been managed in a Microsoft Access database, with registration and payment being handled via Wordpress and WooCommerce. VRWA is seeking an updated solution with the following goals:

- Replace the MS Access db with a purpose built database layer
- Create a more purpose built user interface
- Automatically translate website registrations into this database (Currently, registrations are manually entered into MS Access)
- Allow operators to log in and view their upcoming courses and past completed courses (specifically, number of credit hours earned)
- Enable Vermont state officials to view the training history of operators, to smooth the process of official certification
